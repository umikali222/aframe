# friendly-assembly

friendly-assembly is a piece of software that can tlanslate fasm code (uses the .fa extension) to assembly, which can improve productivity and uhhh idk I made this because I want to write assembly, but I wanted to make it easier

forking and contributions are welcome, which I should probably clarify in the license.

oh wait, there is already a tool called fasm. whoops!
